Nel video di oggi viene presentato un incredibile codice rilasciato di recente che permette di creare simulazioni con agenti autonomi che mostrano comportamenti simili a quelli umani. Questo codice può essere utilizzato per dare vita a personaggi non giocanti (NPC) nei videogiochi o in altri casi d'uso. Nel video vengono mostrati i passaggi per installare il codice e viene spiegato come utilizzarlo. Viene anche mostrato un esempio di simulazione in cui gli agenti mostrano comportamenti come la pianificazione, la formazione di abitudini, la costruzione di relazioni e la memorizzazione di esperienze passate. Viene inoltre fornito un tutorial per personalizzare le simulazioni. L'autore del video consiglia di guardare la sua recensione del documento di ricerca originale per una migliore comprensione.


The video is about the latest software update for the LG C1 and G1 OLEDs. The host does not own these models, but a channel supporter provided information and a screenshot of the update. The software update version is 3.34.95, an improvement from the previous version 3.34.80. The host visited LG's website to find more information about the update, but the website layout has changed and does not provide specific details. However, after researching online and relying on the supporter's information, it seems that the update mainly includes bug fixes and no major improvements. The host also mentions that they have been slow with uploads due to moving houses and renovating a new property. They share a sneak peek of the renovated kitchen and assure viewers that the channel is still active, with more content to come including reviews of new TVs.


This is a speech about a chess problem and how different people might approach finding a solution. The speaker mentions that while they may not see a solution themselves, a skilled chess player or "Grand Master" might be able to solve it instantly. They explain that this is because skilled individuals in any field have a wide range of tools and strategies at their disposal, unlike the speaker who only has their limited chess knowledge. The speaker compares chess to other professions and mentions that successful individuals in those fields also have a wide toolkit, enabling them to solve problems more easily. They also discuss the power of visual stimuli and how it can lead to finding solutions to problems. The speaker gives an example of Jeff Bezos using statistical data to predict the success of launching Amazon. The speaker acknowledges that while intuition and understanding the direction of a particular industry can be helpful, it doesn't guarantee success unless one has the tools and skills to act upon that knowledge. They also mention that many people work continuously to develop their mental models and interpret situations effectively in order to find the best direction. The speaker concludes by mentioning that the majority of people they know, including themselves, often rely solely on their limited knowledge or skillset, metaphorically described as using a hammer to solve every problem.

The speaker asks the listener to look at a chess problem and see if they can find a solution, as they themselves are unable to. They suggest that if the problem is given to a talented chess player, they may find the solution instantly because they are competent in the subject matter. The speaker explains that competent individuals in various fields have a wide range of tools in their toolbox, unlike themselves who only have one chess tool. They mention that chess is emblematic because it requires visually interpreting an image of the game pieces to find the solution. They compare this to Jeff Bezos using statistics about the rapid growth of the internet to launch Amazon, stating that having knowledge about the direction of the world helps a lot. The speaker acknowledges that while they may have insight in the digital tech world, they haven't been able to capitalize on it. They discuss the importance of developing a wide range of mental models to interpret different situations and find the best direction. They conclude by saying that most people they know, including themselves, tend to be limited in their approaches, likening them to stubborn hammer wielders who see every problem as a nail.

Watch this chess problem and tell me if you see a solution because I don't see it. However, if you give this problem to one of these Grand Masters, like Magnus Carlsen, a skilled player who knows the solution, they might find it instantly. Why does this happen? Well, sometimes it's just luck that someone solves it, but in general, it happens because someone is highly competent in that subject. In this case, it happens because a good chess player, just like a skilled athlete, entrepreneur, or doctor, has a wide range of tools in their toolbox. They don't have just one screwdriver like I do in chess. They have many different tools to solve any problem, whether it's building a house or a car. They always have the right tool for the job, whereas I only have my chess screwdriver. Chess is symbolic in this sense because it requires you to look at a picture, a snapshot of the pieces, and from that picture, you have to say, "Ah, the solution is this." It's crazy to think how powerful a simple image or statistic can be. To me, they don't give any signal or input, but to others, they lead to solving the problem entirely. This is where the usual story of Jeff Bezos comes in. Before launching Amazon, he sees the staggering statistic of internet growth, 2500 percent, an astonishing rate, and based on that, he decides to launch Amazon. Now, it's not just about intuiting the direction that e-commerce would explode, but also about actually making it happen with Amazon. That's the big problem, and I agree with you. How many times have I intuited the direction of something, maybe in the digital tech world, but then I wasn't able to do anything about it? Sure, knowing the direction of the world helps a lot, but look around. How many people do you see who actually work continuously, constantly? I don't know what the right answer is to become your own toolbox, but expanding the mental models they have in their heads to interpret every situation and find the best direction is probably not that common. The vast majority of people I know, including your beloved bald Brighton guy, are obsessed hammerers. We're furious hammerers, because as the old saying goes, "When all you have is a hammer, every problem looks like a nail."

Watch this chess problem and tell me if you see a solution because I don't see it. However, if you give this problem to one of those grand masters like Magnus Carlsen, a good player who knows, they might instantly find the solution because they are highly skilled in that topic. In this case, it's because a skilled chess player, just like a skilled athlete, entrepreneur, or doctor, has a wide range of tools at their disposal, unlike me who only has my limited chess knowledge. Chess is emblematic because you have to look at an image, a photograph of the chess pieces, and from there you have to say, "Ah, this is the solution." It's amazing how powerful a simple image or statistic can be in leading you to the solution of a problem. Jeff Bezos's story comes to mind, how before launching Amazon, he saw the staggering growth statistics of the internet, 2500 percent, and he decides to launch Amazon. It's not just about predicting the direction in which e-commerce would explode; it's about actually making it happen with Amazon. That's the challenge. I agree with you. How many times have I predicted the direction of something, maybe in the tech or digital world, but I couldn't actually do anything about it? But don't you agree that it helps a lot to know the direction the world is heading in? Look around, how many people do you see who are continuously working, developing their mental models to interpret every situation and find the best possible direction? There aren't that many. The vast majority of people I know, myself included, are stubborn craftsmen with hammers. We become furious hammerers because, as the saying goes, "If all you have is a hammer, every problem becomes a nail."

Il sottotitolo riguarda la ricerca di una soluzione a un problema scacchistico. L'autore afferma di non riuscire a trovarla, ma suggerisce che un giocatore esperto potrebbe trovarla facilmente grazie alla sua conoscenza e alla sua vasta "cassetta degli attrezzi". L'autore sottolinea l'importanza di avere una vasta gamma di strumenti mentali per analizzare situazioni e trovare le soluzioni migliori. L'autore porta come esempio Jeff Bezos, che ha intuito il potenziale dell'e-commerce e ha fondato Amazon sulla base di questa intuizione. L'autore suggerisce che avere una visione chiara del mondo e delle tendenze può essere molto utile per affrontare i problemi. Si esprime anche la preoccupazione che molte persone tendano ad avere una visione limitata e ad utilizzare sempre lo stesso approccio per risolvere i problemi, come un martello che vede ogni problema come un chiodo.

Il narratore presenta un problema scacchistico e afferma di non vedere la soluzione, ma suggerisce che i Grandi Maestri potrebbero trovarla facilmente. Questo perché i giocatori bravi hanno una vasta gamma di strumenti a loro disposizione e non si affidano solo a una sola soluzione. Successivamente, il narratore riflette sul potere di un'immagine o di una statistica nel fornire soluzioni a un problema. Viene menzionato anche l'esempio di Jeff Bezos, che ha intuito la direzione futura dell'e-commerce guardando la crescita di internet. Infine, si sottolinea l'importanza di ampliare il proprio bagaglio mentale per interpretare le situazioni e trovare le soluzioni migliori, invece di limitarsi ad un unico strumento. In conclusione, si afferma che molti non riescono ad adattarsi perché vedono solo un'unica soluzione per ogni problema, come una persona che conosce solo a martellare e vede ogni problema come un chiodo da colpire.
